Porta Cipher encrytor

1. First menu option asks an user to enter a keyword(any length)
2.For second the user should enter a valid file or url name(otherwise exception occurs) and a file to write to.
3.Option to encrypt or decrypt a file

if any exception occurs during entering a file name a programme will asks for a valid name again

in terms of time complexity this app is very fast ,the use of HashMap allows you to store a duplicate
values and access by means of key which is O(1) constant time hashCode has been overridden in char class

Parseable interface lets us decide in run time which method from what class to call(using polymorphism)
Each character is being processed ,transform to upper case ,all non-letter chars are skipped,
getting a value by indexing in an array and hashmap O(1) constant time,
iterating thru a file by reading  all characters is linear O(n).
